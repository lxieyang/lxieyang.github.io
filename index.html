      I am a first year Ph.D. student at <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> @ <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
      My current research interests include <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>, <strong>hybrid intelligent systems</strong>, <strong>user interface development</strong>, and <strong>interactive machine learning</strong>. 
      My advisors are <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/">Dr. Brad A. Myers</a> and <a href="http://kittur.org/">Dr. Niki Kittur</a>. 
      I obtained my two B.S. degrees at <a href="https://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> and <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>. I worked as an undergraduate researcher with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/">Dr. Walter S. Lasecki</a> in the <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html">Crowds + Machines Lab (Croma Lab)</a> during my time in Michigan.

I began my **programming journey** with `C` and `C++`, so I'm pretty familiar with those two languages. I'm also good at using `MATLAB` to do **batch processing** and **image manipulation**, which is very common in **machine learning** and **computer vision**. I'm currently using `Java` and `Python` to write several course projects as well as other small applications.

Right now, I'm focusing on using `HTML5`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `jQuery`, `Bootstrap`, etc., to perform web-development. The direct result is this [Homepage](/) I've been developing and maintaining. I recently re-wrote the entire site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a simple, awesome, blog-aware, static site generator.

I learned `LaTeX` during my freshmen year while writing project papers. During my time serving as a teaching assistant for a multivariate calculus course, I dedicated much of my time mastering `Beamer`, which is one of the `LaTeX` packages that deals specifically with presentations.
