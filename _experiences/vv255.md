"Be the change you want to see in the world." ---- by Mahatma Gandhi

I served as a teaching assistant in summer 2015 under the supervision of [Dr. Jing Liu](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/jing-liu/). I independently built the entire set of discussion slides, which are in wide use by the TAs in the following semesters. I prepared and led weekly recitation sessions and office hours that review the lecture contents as well as cultivate students' problem-solving skills. I also graded homework assignments and exams, and reported to my faculty supervisor problems of any kind.

Although I only taught for three month, I knew that I had made a difference.
