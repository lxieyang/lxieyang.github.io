<!-- Hi, I'm Xieyang Liu! You can call me **Michael**! -->

I am a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in the [Computer Science and Engineering](http://eecs.umich.edu/cse/) department. Prior to Michigan, I was an undergraduate student at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was awarded the Tang-Junyuan Fellowship (2015-2017).


I am honored to be an undergraduate researcher in the [Crowds + Machines Lab](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html) advised by [Dr. Walter S. Lasecki](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/). My research interests include Human-computer Interaction, intelligent systems, user interface development, and human-in-the-loop machine learning. My vision is to build intelligent systems and interfaces that improve everyday experiences, and investigate how machine learning could be integrated into the solution.


<!--
I began my **programming journey** with `C` and `C++`, so I'm pretty familiar with those two languages. I'm also good at using `MATLAB` to do **batch processing** and **image manipulation**, which is very common in **machine learning** and **computer vision**. I'm currently using `Java` and `Python` to write several course projects as well as other small applications.

Right now, I'm focusing on using `HTML5`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `jQuery`, `Bootstrap`, etc., to perform web-development. The direct result is this [Homepage](/) I've been developing and maintaining. I recently re-wrote the entire site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a simple, awesome, blog-aware, static site generator.
