Hi, I'm Xieyang Liu! You can call me Michael.

I'm a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in the [Computer Science and Engineering](http://eecs.umich.edu/cse/) department. I'm currently a research assistant at the University of Michigan [Croma Lab](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html) under the supervision of [Prof Walter S. Lasecki](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/). My research interests are computer vision, machine learning, and web-development. I would like to be a software engineer upon graduation.

I started my **programming journey** with `C` and `C++`, so I'm pretty familiar with those two languages. I'm also good at using `MATLAB` to do **batch processing** and **image manipulation**, which is very common in **machine learning** and **computer vision**. I'm currently using `Java` and `Python` to write several course projects as well as other small applications.

Right now, I'm focusing on using `HTML5`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `jQuery`, `Bootstrap`, etc., to perform web-development. The direct result is this [Homepage](/) I've been developing and maintaining. I recently re-wrote the entire site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a simple, awesome, blog-aware, static site generator.  

I learned `LaTeX` during my freshmen year while writing project papers. During my time serving as a teaching assistant for a multivariate calculus course, I dedicated much of my time mastering `Beamer`, which is one of the `LaTeX` packages that deals specifically with presentations. To take a look at those presentations I created, please hit the [Selected Works](./works) button in the navigation bar.

Please hit the [Skills](./skills) button in the navigation bar to view my current yet developing skill set...
