      abstract: "In this paper we study the problem of detecting human-object interactions (HOI) in static images, defined as predicting a human and an object bounding box with an interaction class label that connects them. HOI detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision as it provides semantic information about the interactions among the detected objects. We introduce HICO-DET, a new large benchmark for HOI detection, by augmenting the current HICO classification benchmark with instance annotations. We propose Human-Object Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (HO-RCNN), a novel DNN-based framework for HOI detection. At the core of our HO-RCNN is the Interaction Pattern, a novel DNN input that characterizes the spatial relations between two bounding boxes. We validate the effectiveness of our HO-RCNN using HICO-DET. Experiments demonstrate that our HO-RCNN, by exploiting human-object spatial relations through Interaction Patterns, significantly improves the performance of HOI detection over baseline approaches.

      abstract: "Programmers spend a signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of their time searching for and making sense of complex information. However, they often lack effective tools to help them make sense of the information, turn it into knowledge, or share it with their respective communities. In this position paper, we aim to help programmers collect, navigate, and organize knowledge to meet their goals while capturing this knowledge and making it useful for later programmers with similar needs. We describe barriers and challenges to creating this sustainable cycle, and we explore the design space and opportunities for effective tools and systems.",
