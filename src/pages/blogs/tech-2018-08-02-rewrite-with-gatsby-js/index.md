I've been planning this rewrite for a while. I want my site to be built with tomorrow's technology. I want it to be fast and responsive. I want to experiment with PWA. I want something better than [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is what I used to build the last version of my website. Finally made up my mind to do it when [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) hits beta.

This journey wasn't easy. [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) is still missing a lot of proper documentation. Some can be "borrowed" from v1 docs, some are... You just have to ask around and figure things out.

Luckily, I'm on the other end, writing this very first blog post. Feeling grateful.

There will be more nice stuff to come.

Happy hacking. Michael out.

PS: I recently ruptured my Achilles tendon when playing basketball. I'll probably use this new platform to document my recovery process, which could take a year. Current goal: being able to sit in a chair. Bigger goal: being able to stand and walk.
