# Workspace Rules

- **Sync Before Starting:** Before working on anything, run `git pull origin gatsby-dev` to ensure your local branch is in sync with the cloud.
- **Sync Before Pushing:** Before pushing your changes, run `git pull origin gatsby-dev` again to resolve any potential conflicts.
- **Deploy After Pushing:** After pushing changes to `gatsby-dev`, always run `npm run deploy` to ensure the site is updated.
