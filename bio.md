Xieyang (Michael) Liu is a senior in the Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan, where he works as an undergraduate researcher with [Dr. Walter S. Lasecki](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/) in the [Crowds + Machines Lab (Croma Lab)](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html). Xieyang develops intelligent systems that support human-in-the-loop machine learning and enhance end-user experiences.  Xieyang's current research interests include Human-computer Interaction, intelligent systems, user interface development, and interactive machine learning. Prior to Croma Lab, Xieyang worked as a research assistant in the [Vision & Learning Lab](https://vl-lab.eecs.umich.edu) with [Dr. Jia Deng](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jiadeng/) on static image recognition.

Xieyang was previously an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he was awarded Tang-Junyuan Scholarship (top 2) for two consecutive years. He won the Meritorious Winner prize in 2015 COMAP - Mathematical Contest in Modeling during his sophomore year. He also served as a teaching assistant for multivariate calculus in SJTU working with [Dr. Jing Liu](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/jing-liu/).

<!--
I'm a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in the [Computer Science and Engineering](http://eecs.umich.edu/cse/) department. I'm currently a research assistant at the University of Michigan [Croma Lab](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html) under the supervision of [Prof Walter S. Lasecki](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/). My research interests are computer vision, machine learning, and web-development. I would like to be a software engineer upon graduation.

During my junior year in Michigan, I served as a research assistant at the University of Michigan [Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/ai/) under the supervision of [Prof Jia Deng](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jiadeng/).

Before that, I was an ECE student at the [University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](http://www.umji.sjtu.edu.cn/en/). During my time there, I served as a teaching assistant for the course Vv255 Applied Calculus III under the supervision of [Dr. Jing Liu](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/jing-liu/). I was also a member of the [UM-SJTU JI Honor Council](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/academic-integrity/).
