Imagine that you go into a travel agency in US. You book a flight all around the world just to arrive in China. And they put you into buses, drive you round the city, you see a lot of big sites, and they send you to the most expensive restaurants in town. At the end of the day, you fly back to your hometown.
**Isn't that what you could do all the way back in the States as well?**
