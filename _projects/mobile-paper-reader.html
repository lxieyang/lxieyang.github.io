<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    Ever experienced reading research papers on your phone? It sucked, right? The phone screens are just too small for those magnificant pdf documents people worked so hard to format.
</p>
<p>
    With this app, you could just put in the link to the paper you want to read, wait a little while for the app to parse the pdf document using some advanced text extraction algorithms from <a href="https://indico.io">indico</a>, and then read the paper like you are reading a normal article on your phone screen. To illustrate, you just went from <strong>this</strong>:
</p>

<img width="250" src="{{ page.reading_pdf_img_path }}" />

<p>
    to <strong>this</strong>:
</p>

<img width="250" src="{{ page.reading_parsed_pdf_img_path }}" />

<p>
    And of course, it comes in with the ability to adjust the font size and the background:
</p>

<img width="250" src="{{ page.settings_img }}" />
