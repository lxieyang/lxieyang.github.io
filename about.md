<h2>Misc.</h2>

- My Chinese name is 刘燮洋. I was born in an amazing city,  [Wuxi](https://goo.gl/maps/V6MFTpQe3Un), where I was brought up with by lots of love from my family and friends.
- My motto has always been: "Be the change you want to see in the world." (by Mahatma Gandhi)
- I hosted various activities and shows when I was in high school and college. Love it.
- My favorite song and favorite album of all time are both [Hotel California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_California). It is the only song that I can't get tired of. And I'm pretty sure I never will.
- I play the guitar, mostly acoustic, from age 16. Though recently I started teaching myself to play the electric ones. I even made my own [portable laser guitar]({{ site.project_links.laserguitar }}) during freshmen year. Believe it or not, I can play Hotel California with that :-)
- I enjoy reading. My favorite magazine is [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com). I also like watching TV series and movies, especially thrillers. I love [Prison Break](http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak) and [24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)). Really can't tell which is better. I mean Jack Bauer saves the world and Michael Scofield saves the family!
- I'm a gym worm. I like the saying ["自律给我自由"](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/自律给我自由). I believe regular work out is the only way towards a healthy and prosperous life.
